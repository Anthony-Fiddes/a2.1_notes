When a word has one syllable, its plural form will gain a syllable and its vowel
will change.

E.g. Stadt -> Stä-dte

# Der/Die/Das

Masculine things tend to have a straight and tall shape, like a man. Z.b.:

- der Baum
- der Mercedes

They might also be considered strong/heavy/hard:

- der Stein
- der Diamant
- der Wodka

Feminine things tend to have a curvier shape, like a woman. Z.b.:

- die Yamaha
- die Harley-Davidson

Basically there are a bunch of old sexist ideas about form and function that
originally defined the genders of many words. Das is for stuff that doesn't fit
cleanly into those categories of thought (z.b. they may come in many different
shapes and forms that are curvy or mannish). It seems like it's a bit arbitrary,
since different cultures assign different genders to the same concepts.

A more consistent marker seems to be certain semantic and grammatical categories
that words belong to.

## Die

Semantic categories:

- The names of boats and planes
- The names of trees and flowers
- The brand names of motorcycles
- Country names that end in -ei, -ie, or -e. (The rest are neuter)

Grammatical categories:

- Words with certain suffixes from other languages:
  - -a, -anz, -enz, -ik, -tion, -tät, -ur
- Words with certain German suffixes: -ei, -in, -heit, -keit, -schaft,
  -ung
  - An exception is der Papagei, since it's a living animal. The gender will
    depend on the sex of the animal

## Der

Semantic categories:

- The names of the weekdays, months, and the seasons
- The names of many weather phenomena and the cardinal directions
- The names of gems and minerals
- The names of mountains and most rivers (some German rivers are feminine)
- The names of car brands
  - If a brand makes both cars and motorcycles, a car owner might use "der" and
    a motorcycle owner might say "die".
- The names of spirits
  - das Bier ist nicht stark, also es nicht hier passt.

Grammatical categories:

- Words ending in -ich, -ig, -ling, -s, -er, -ismus, -ist, -ant, -ast, and -us

## Das

Semantic categories:

- The names of colors
- The names of chemical elements
- The names of medications
- The names of countries, cities, towns, and villages
- The names of letters
- The names of hotels and cafés

Grammatical categories:

- Words ending in -o, -chen, -lein, -icht, -tel, -tum, -nis
- Words ending in the foreign suffixes -ma, -ett, -ent, -ing

## Worte mit Doppelter Genus

There are words that can be used with either der or das. Depending on your
region, one form may be more popular than the other.

Examples include:

- Bonbon
- Curry
- Dschungel
- Filter
- Joghurt
- Keks
- Liter
- Virus

Some words change meaning if you use a different gender.

- der Gummi is a material, das Gummi is a condom
- der Poster is a person posting on social media, das Poster is a poster on a
  wall
- der Teil is a part of a sequence, das Teil is just a thing

# Pronunciation

In general German defaults to using long vowels. If a vowel is followed by a
double consonant (z.b. "denn"), then it is meant to be pronounced as a short
vowel.

- The useful example that our teacher gave is that a common error is to pronounce
  the article "den" with a short "e", which would be perceived by native speakers
  as "denn".

# Akkusativ vs Dativ

Dativ comes from the Latin "to give". The Dativ form is used when giving
something or doing something for the benefit (or downfall) of someone. It
indicates the receiver of something. Z.b.:

- Der Kaffee schmeckt **mir**.
  - The coffee is conveying a benefit to me (its taste). If we changed "mir" to
    "mich", this would suggest that it was possible for the coffee to taste me (as
    if it had a tongue). Coffee is an inanimate object, not an agent that can do
    things like tasting or writing or running.
- Ich schreibe mein**er** Freundin eine Nachricht.
  - I write a message that my girlfriend **receives**. I am writing the letter
    for her to receive as an "advantage".

It is also used to indicate the instrument with which someone did something.

## Präpositionen

There are Präpositionen that take only Dativ. Use the mnemonic **aubemina
vonseizu** to remember them. They are:

- **au**s
- **be**i
- **mi**r
- **na**ch
- **von**
- **sei**t
- **zu**
- ab

For the ones that only take Akkusativ, use the mnemonic **fudog**:

- **f**ür
- **u**m
- **d**urch
- **o**hne
- **g**egen
- bis

Die Wechsel Präpositionen nehmen Akkusativ **oder** Dativ, die sind:

- in
- an
- auf
- neben
- über
- vor
- hinter
- zwischen
- unter

Another way to remember these prepositions is that they **can** be used to
indicate movement. When they take an Akkusativ object, they (in most cases)
indicate movement from one place to another. Z.b.

- Die Kommode ist neben der Tür. Die Kommode geht nicht zu einem Ort, es steht
  da schon.
- Die Kommode geht neben die Tür. Die Kommode doch geht zu einem Ort. Sie wird da
  stehen, weil jemand sie da stellen wird.
- "Ich fliege in die Türkei" means that I flew into Turkey from another country
  (Akkusativ). Aber "Ich fliege in der Türkei" means that I flew from a place in
  Turkey to another place that is in Turkey.

# Präpositionen

Nach is used with a movement to a city, state, or country, whereas zu is used for a
movement with a more specific destination (like a specific shop or building). Z.b.:

- Ich ziehe nach Stuttgart um.
  - I could have moved to any building in Stuttgart.
