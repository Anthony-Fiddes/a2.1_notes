When a word has one syllable, its plural form will gain a syllable and its vowel
will change.

E.g. Stadt -> Stä-dte

# Der/Die/Das

Masculine things tend to have a straight and tall shape, like a man. Z.b.:

- der Baum
- der Mercedes

They might also be considered strong/heavy/hard:

- der Stein
- der Diamant
- der Wodka

Feminine things tend to have a curvier shape, like a woman. Z.b.:

- die Yamaha
- die Harley-Davidson

Basically there are a bunch of old sexist ideas about form and function that
originally defined the genders of many words. Das is for stuff that doesn't fit
cleanly into those categories of thought (z.b. they may come in many different
shapes and forms that are curvy or mannish). It seems like it's a bit arbitrary,
since different cultures assign different genders to the same concepts.

A more consistent marker seems to be certain semantic and grammatical categories
that words belong to.

## Die

Semantic categories:

- The names of boats and planes

    depend on the sex of the animal
